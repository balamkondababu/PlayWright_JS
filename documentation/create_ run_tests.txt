Step 1 - Create a new file under test folder
Step 2 - Add module ‘playwright/test’
    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

 ** test, expect  ------ functions from @playwright/test module
Playwright Test provides a test function to declare tests and expect function to write assertions

Step 3 - Create a test block - test(title, testFunction)
 The keyword 'async' before a function makes the function return a promise
The keyword 'await' before a function makes the function wait for a promise

Step 4 - Run the test
npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed  FirstTest.spec.js

runs all tests on all browsers in headless mode:
npx playwright test

runs a specific test file:
npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js

runs the files specified:
npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js  MyTest2.spec.js

 runs test with the title:
npx playwright test -g "test title"

runs on specific browser:
npx playwright test --project=chromium

runs tests in headed mode:
npx playwright test --headed

debug tests:
npx playwright test --debug

debug specific test file:
npx playwright test example.spec.js --debug
